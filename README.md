# K--MEANS-CLUSTERING-USING-PCA
Clustering is employed in a variety of fields, including  Engineering, Biology, Psychology, Economics, and Recommendation systems. Because the number of clusters or model parameters is seldom  known and must be determined before clustering, the fundamental  issue of cluster analysis is that the number of clusters or model  parameters is rarely known and must be determined before clustering.  A clustering method with several clusters has been presented. The kmeans approach is a basic and quick clustering technique among  them. We use a k-means strategy to solve the problem of cluster  number selection. End users might be asked to supply several clusters  ahead of time.
